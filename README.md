# re!Schedule

This is a project mentored by UBC's Diversity in CS Project Hub.

Aimed to increase the accessibility of recycling schedules in the Vancouver, 
this web-app(currently) incorporates

- location detection that pin points it on the visual map
- Google Places and Geocoding API that finds a location and pin points it on the visual map


Implemented but not incorporated:
- output of all holiday dates in a year using MongoDB
- taking in a district and outputing all bin collection dates
- Google Calendar API that saves all relevant bin collecting dates onto your personal calendar (if given permission)

Future plans:
- to further this into a mobile app
